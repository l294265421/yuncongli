B.E., Digital Media Technology, School of Software, Yunnan University, Kunming, Yunnan, China

### Research interests
* Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis
* Information Extraction

### Relevant Work Experiences
* Sept. 2020 - Present, Senior R&D Engineer (Natural Language Processing & Recommender System), Tencent, Shenzhen, China
    * Explore casual inference, especially counterfactual learning, on news recommendation. Our goal is to improve the performance of our news recommender system for silent users in QQ Browser.
* May 2018 - Sept. 2020, Senior R&D Engineer (Natural Language Processing), Baidu, Shenzhen, China
    * Opinion mining and sentiment analysis: propose and implement algorithms which predict the sentiments of texts or extract opinion triplets from texts.
    * Topic Detection and Tracking: implement algorithms which cluster news and generate storyline.
    * Event Evolutionary Graph: implement algorithms which first extract events from texts, then recognize their relations (e.g. causal relation and temporal relation) between the events, finally construct event evolutionary graph based on the events and relations.
