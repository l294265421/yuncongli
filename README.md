### Education
* Sept. 2010 - Jun. 2015,
B.Eng, Digital Media Technology, School of Software, Yunnan University

### Research interests
* Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis
* Information Extraction

### Relevant Work Experiences
* Sept. 2020 - Present, Senior Research and Development Engineer (Natural Language Processing & Recommender System), Tencent, Shenzhen, China
    * News Recommendation: Explore casual inference, especially counterfactual learning, on news recommendation. Our goal is to improve the performance of our news recommender system for silent users in [QQ Browser](https://feeds.qq.com/).
    * Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis: also explore counterfactual learning on some sentiment analysis subtasks.
* May 2018 - Sept. 2020, Senior Research and Development Engineer (Natural Language Processing), Baidu, Shenzhen, China
    * Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis: propose and implement algorithms which predict the sentiments of texts or extract opinion triplets from texts.
    * Topic Detection and Tracking: implement algorithms which cluster news and generate storylines.
    * Event Evolutionary Graph: implement algorithms which first extract events from texts, then recognize their relations (e.g. causal relation and temporal relation), finally construct event evolutionary graph based on the events and relations.
    * These algorithms were deployed on [Baidu yuqing](http://yuqing.baidu.com/saas/intro/newindex?castk=LTE%3D).
